# Blender: 3D Modelling

I've recently started my journey in mastering Blender 3D. Amazing platform, and fantastic capabilities - especially with the inlcusion of new features in 2.8.

Will start to upload some of my new models here as I progress through the Blender tutorials by [Grant Abbitt](http://gabbitt.co.uk/about-1/index.html), [Andrew Price](https://www.blenderguru.com/about) and other 3D artists.

## Humanoid - Bust

Followed Grant's tutorial on using Sculpting in Blender 2.8.
